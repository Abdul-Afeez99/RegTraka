# RegTraka
RegTraka is my Final Year project at the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta as a Mechatronics Engineering Student. 
## About 
This project provides a highly efficient and cost-effective automated attendance system designed specifically for educational institutions. The system makes use of computer vision technology, which works in tandem with an IP camera to record detailed video footage of the whole classroom. This permits real-time data streaming to an easy-to-use web application.
The web application offers a significant level of adaptability, allowing teachers to start and end attendance sessions whenever they choose, giving them maximum control over classroom activities. The face recognition model, a key element of this system, is built using the highly recognized Python face-recognition library and the powerful OpenCV library.
The web applicationâ€™s front end is designed using React.js to provide a user-friendly and interactive interface. The backend of the system utilizes DjangoRestFramework to create robust APIs, ensuring smooth interaction between the front end and the underlying database, thereby enhancing the user experience.
This all-inclusive solution not only simplifies the process of managing attendance but also embodies a design that prioritises the user, providing educators with increased control and adaptability in tracking and documenting student attendance by incorporating advanced computer vision technologies.
